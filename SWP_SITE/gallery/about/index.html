<h2>Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime!</h2>

<br>
<p>Join us for exploration, adventure and self-reflection on the warm, sunny coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, cradled in the Caribbean Sea. Be inspired to live your best year ever by challenging yourself, building connections, and maximizing your well-being.
</p>

<p>
Over the past six years, two best friends Amy Lee and Nikki Jay, have dedicated one week at the dawn of each new year to reflect on the previous year, illuminate shadows in the present, and set actions in motion for the future. We hold the mirror to each other, asking “Who are you now?” and “Who are you willing to be next year?” How many times do we tell ourselves “No,” “Later” and “Not now”?” Give yourself permission to say “Yes,” “Now,” and “I’m ready!”
</p>

<p>
We want to invite you on this exclusive quest to reveal what is true for you. Reach the places outside of your comfort zone as we guide you to the possibilities and next steps on your path. We will nurture your spirit, inspire fearlessness, and challenge you to action in the new year.
